Microcephaly patient Ana Carolina Caceres: 'I survived'
Brazilian Ana Carolina Caceres was born with microcephaly, a congenital malformation by which babies have abnormally small heads and may suffer from delayed brain development.This condition has been suspected to be linked to the current epidemic of Zika virus in the Americas. The recent spike in cases of microcephaly has led to a petition, led by a group of lawyers and activists, to change abortion legislation in Brazil: laws currently allow it only in cases of rape, when the mother's life is at risk, or if the foetus has anencephaly, a rare condition in which the baby is missing the brain.The 24-year-old journalist, who lives in the southern state of Mato Grosso, was dismayed by the comments, and decided to tell BBC Brasil her story, which is translated into English here.Video produced by Michael Hirst
