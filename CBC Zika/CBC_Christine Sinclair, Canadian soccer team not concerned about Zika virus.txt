Christine Sinclair, Canadian soccer team not concerned about Zika virus
Canadians look ahead to Olympic qualifier
Captain Christine Sinclair says the Canadian soccer team is thinking of other things than the Zika virus as it bids to qualify for the Rio Olympics."No. I haven't heard our team talk about it once, to be honest," she told a news conference Wednesday on the eve of playing Guyana at the CONCACAF Women's Olympic Qualifying tournament on Thursday (CBCSports.ca, CBC Sports app, 8:30 p.m. ET)."Our focus is [Thursday night] and that's pretty much where we're staying focused at. Let's qualify for the Olympics first and then we'll move onto that."There was a different reaction at the U.S. camp where U.S. goalkeeper Hope Solo said Wednesday if the Olympics were held today, she would not go out of concern about the virus."Fortunately, the Olympics are six months away. So, I believe we have some time to get our doubts and questions answered," Solo said after a 5-0 win over Costa Rica.The Zika virus has spread rapidly in Latin America. Transmitted by mosquitoes, most people have few symptoms. But it is suspected of causing microcephaly, a birth defect marked by an abnormally small head. Pregnant women are urged to avoid travel to affected areas.
