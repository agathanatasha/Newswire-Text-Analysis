Concerns over clinical trials with pregnant women could delay a Zika vaccine
Read story transcriptIn early Feb. 2016, the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency with the Zika virus "spreading,explosively" across Latin and South America. And its apparent link to microcephaly, a serious birth defect that leaves babies with smaller heads and brains, means pregnant women have the most to fear from Zika.A pregnant woman waits at the Maternal and Children's Hospital in Tegucigalpa, Jan. 21, 2016. The medical school at the National Autonomous University of Honduras (UNAH) recommended women in the country avoid getting pregnant for the time being due to the presence of the Zika virus.

He estimates it is possible a vaccine could be created in about two years but not in time to be used for this round of infection.Clinical tests involving pregnant women raise some important ethical issues.Françoise Baylis, a Canada research chair in bioethics and philosophy at Dalhouse University, is calling for pregnant women to be included in clinical trials at a later stage in the clinical testing process and thinks the pharmaceutical needs of pregnant women are not addressed thanks to the current industry standard of excluding them from testing.This segment was produced by The Current's Howard Goldenthal.RELATED LINKS♦ Race is on to develop Zika vaccine but tests on pregnant women raise concern ♦ An Indian biotech company has been developing Zika vaccines for over a year ♦ Zika Vaccine: Another Example Of Waiting Until It's Too Late?
