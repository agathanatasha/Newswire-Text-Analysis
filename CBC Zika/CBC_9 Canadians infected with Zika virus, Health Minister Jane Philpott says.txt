9 Canadians infected with Zika virus, Health Minister Jane Philpott says
Virus was contracted outside of Canada in all cases, with no local transmission, minister says
The number of Canadians infected with the Zika virus has risen to nine, Health Minister Jane Philpott said Wednesday.The minister said there have been no cases of locally transmitted Zika virus in Canada."We can assume that they were most likely mosquito-borne, but they were all contracted [outside] the country, not local transmission," Philpott said.The minister could not confirm whether the virus was or could be sexually transmitted.​One of the cases has been confirmed in Alberta, and another two in B.C. that were contracted in El Salvador and Colombia, according to the B.C. Centre for Disease control.Health officials in both provinces have said there is no risk to public health in the province.Philpott stressed people should be cautious when travelling abroad.Brazilian officials still say they believe there's a sharp increase in cases of microcephaly and strongly suspect the Zika virus, which first appeared in the country last year, is to blame.
