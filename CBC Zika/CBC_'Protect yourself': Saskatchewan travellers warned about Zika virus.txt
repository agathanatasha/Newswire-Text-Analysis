Some people in Saskatchewan may want to reconsider their winter getaway plans.The Zika virus has been transmitted in 21 countries in Central and South America, as well as some Caribbean countries. Brazil is the country worst affected by the outbreak.The mosquito-borne virus is believed to be capable of causing serious birth defects of the brain, and results in a smaller than average head in babies.Denise Werker, Saskatchewan's Deputy Chief Medical Health Officer, said women who are pregnant or trying to conceive may want to hold off on a trip south."Pregnant women may not even know that they've been infected," Werker said. "We know that only one to four, or one out of five, who get infected may have symptoms. And those symptoms are generally mild. The symptoms would not necessarily prompt you to seek health care."Denise Werker is Saskatchewan's Deputy Chief Medical Health Officer. (CBC)There have been four cases reported in Canada among people who have travelled to affected areas.People who have already booked a trip to countries affected by the outbreak may be able to catch a break.WestJet , Air Canada, and Air Transat are allowing some passengers travelling to infected areas to change or cancel flights.WestJet said refunds will be given in the form of future travel credit. A spokesperson with WestJet told CBC Saskatchewan they "recommend that anyone who has concerns speak with their doctor or turn to sources such as WHO for more information."For people who are still planning to travel to affected areas, Werker said they should take extra precautions."The basic message is protect yourself against mosquito bites by covering up, using insect repellents, staying in screened areas, sleeping under a bed net," Werker said.
