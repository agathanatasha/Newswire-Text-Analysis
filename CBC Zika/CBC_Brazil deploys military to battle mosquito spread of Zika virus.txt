Brazil deploys military to battle mosquito spread of Zika virus
Scientists believe virus linked to surge of babies born with brain defect microcephaly
More than 200,000 army, navy and air force troops are fanning out across Brazil to show people how to eliminate the Aedes aegypti mosquito that spreads the Zika virus, which many health officials believe is linked to severe birth defects.The nationwide offensive is part of President Dilma Rousseff's declared war on the virus that has quickly spread across the Americas.The government says 220,000 members of the armed forces accompanied by community health agents and mosquito control teams are taking part in Saturday's effort to educate the population on how to eliminate mosquito breeding areas in and around their homes.The government says troops will visit 3 million homes in 356 municipalities to hand out explanatory pamphlets.Among these are 115 priority cities, which registered a rate of over 100 cases of dengue per 100,000 habitants in the months of November and December of 2015.Scientists believe the Aedes aegypti mosquito can carry Zika virus.
