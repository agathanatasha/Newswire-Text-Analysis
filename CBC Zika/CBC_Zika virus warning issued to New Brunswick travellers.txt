(CBC)Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's acting chief medical officer of health, is warning potential travellers about the disease."Anybody that is pregnant, or choosing to become pregnant in the next little while, should really seek advice from their health-care professional about their travel plans, and make a decision about postponing, or not," said Russell.Travel agent Marilyn Baird has already dealt with cancellations due to the virus."I was speaking with a colleague of mine who does a lot of destination weddings and she has had a couple of cancellations," said Baird. "There's been people in the wedding group, that were pregnant, who have chosen not to travel."Travel agent Marilyn Baird is aware of people changing destination wedding plans because of the Zika virus. (CBC)The World Health Organization has been dealing with what it terms an "explosive" outbreak for several weeks.No cases of Zika virus are known to have originated in Canada, but some travelling Canadians have brought the virus back to the country with them.Some people spoken to about the virus on Thursday in Fredericton said if there was a risk associated with the virus, they weren't prepared to take it."There's no way I would go anywhere," said Jennifer O'Leary."I'm sure that we would stay away from infected areas, or areas that were more prone to it," said Ruthie English."It's a concern, but I don't feel threatened by it, if that's what you mean," said Tianna Gerber. "I mean, any kind of disease or virus is upsetting, but I don't feel personally threatened by it."Anyone travelling to any of the 20 affected countries is advised to take precautions, including the use of bug spray and netting to avoid any possible contact with mosquitoes.
