Zika virus presents concerns for Sudburians escaping the cold
Pregnant women should be aware of travel risks, public health nurse says
The Zika virus plaguing several countries in South and Central America poses a myriad of concerns for Sudburians with travel plans.The mosquito-borne virus has been linked to thousands of birth defects in Brazil. If bitten by an infected Aedes mosquito, one may experience a fever, joint paint, low energy and a rash.Leah Miller of Merit Travel in Sudbury told CBC News she's been receiving many calls from worried clients."Traveling is always something that somebody should be careful in choosing a destination in ensuring that their shots are up to date, ensuring they have proper medical advice," Miller said.The illness is especially frightening for pregnant women as the illness is linked to microcephely, a birth defect that causes babies to be born with underdeveloped brains. That's why one nurse said it is critical for pregnant women to understand the risks before booking a flight to a sunny destination."We are advising pregnant women to take those precautions to avoid chances of getting bit by a mosquito and the potential complications that come of that," said public health nurse Stephanie Vendetti-Hastie with the Sudbury and District Health Unit.And keep in mind Brazil is not the only country infected. The virus has been reported as far north as Mexico and parts of the Caribbean, which are popular travel destinations for Canadians. Other countries that have experienced the Zika virus include Barbados, Bolivia, Colombia and Ecuador.There is currently no available vaccine for the infection.
