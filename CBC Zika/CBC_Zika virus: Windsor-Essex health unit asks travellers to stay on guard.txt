Zika virus: Windsor-Essex health unit asks travellers to stay on guard
'For pregnant women, if they can postpone their trip at this point, that's great'
The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit is asking travellers to talk to their doctors before travelling to places where the Zika virus is spreading, but it's not issuing a formal travel warning.The Zika virus is spread by mosquito bites and causes mild infections, but it appears to present more danger to pregnant women.There is mounting evidence a Zika infection in pregnant women is associated with a birth defect for the child where the head is smaller than normal and the brain doesn't develop properly.However, Canada's chief public health officer said Friday "we don't know what the real association is between the ZikaVirus and microcephaly."Still, the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit is urging pregnant women to be cautious."For pregnant women, if they can postpone their trip at this point, that's great," Dr. Wajid Ahmed, the public health unit's associate director of health told CBC News. "If they cannot postpone their trip, then use all the precaution that they can to prevent themselves from getting the Zika virus."Dr. Wajid Ahmed says he wants to see a plan for regulating marijuana in place before marijuana is legalized. (CBC)Those precautions include wearing long sleeves and pants as well as wearing insect repellant with DEET, Ahmed explained.Officials from the Ministry of Health say there are four cases where Canadians contracted the Zika virus while abroad.Two of those people were from B.C and another was from Alberta. Since there haven't been any people from Ontario infected, Ahmed said the health unit is simply reminding residents to stay vigilant.There have been no cases the virus being contracted in Canada and the World Health Organization has said the Zika virus is unlikely to spread here."People who are making travel plans should consult with their healthcare providers to get the appropriate advice on what they need to do based on the place they are visiting," Ahmed said.The Public Health Agency of Canada has issued a travel advisory for Canadians going to South and Central America. It's also recommending pregnant women discuss their travel plans with their healthcare providers and consider postponing their trip.Several Canadian airlines, including WestJet and Air Canada say they will let travellers change their bookings because of concerns.Sunwing Airlines is the only airline flying directly from Windsor to Cancun, Mexico, where the Zika virus is a concern.In a statement to CBC, Sunwing it is "monitoring the Zika virus very carefully and has established a policy that addresses the concerns of pregnant customers who have approached us on a case by case basis."Customers can, in certain circumstances, get a refund on their airfare."For customers due to travel who have not purchased cancellation insurance, and have been advised against traveling to affected areas by their physician, we are requesting that they obtain a medical note. Upon review of their individual circumstances and provided they have a medical note, Sunwing will allow customers to make changes to their travel plans for no additional fees or cancel their trip for a full refund," the statement reads.The company also suggests travellers buy its insurance that allows cancellation coverage for any reason.
